# Java-Prime

### Here I got all the codes I wrote in the java sessions.
### Now I will try to put them in a markdown file so that I can easily upload them to my github repo.
### The naming of the folders are little bad still I would like to improve it.

### TODO:
### *) Arrange the folders in a better way.
